# Image-Segmentation
This project demonstrates image segmentation using the Oxford Pets dataset, a widely-used dataset for semantic segmentation tasks. The segmentation model uses various techniques, including a ResNet50-based down-sampler as well as MobileNetV2-based down-sampler, Conv2DTranspose, Conv layers, transfer learning with ResNet50 and MobileNetV2, Pix2Pix as the up-sampler ,and a custom upsampler. Moreover, I used this project as an opportunity to learn also how to create a data generator especially if a dataset is too large to fit in memory during training. However, its training was a bit too slow so I downloaded the dataset from tf datasets and used normal tensorflow pipelining to speed up training.
